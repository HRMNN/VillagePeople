Project Title: "Where did the Village People go?"

Short Description: Claiming all Germans “Go West“ is inaccurate: Municipalities across the Federal Republic are loosing or gaining from Inner-German Migration. But who is moving? Where are they coming from and going to? What places are attracting and which are repulsing? And what do each have in common? This Project combines Data accumulated by the Bertelsmann Stiftung with Artificial Intelligence to make predictions and find root-causes.
